/**
 * Waits for the activation of a step.
 * When the step is activated, the wait ends.
 *
 * The purpose of WaitForStepActivations is to be combined with one or more
 * WaitForProperties using a WaitForAnd. If the properties have the expected
 * value when the step is activated, the associated slot is executed or the next
 * step is requested (depending on the Step::addWaitFor() method used). It can
 * be used to set "preconditions" for a step, and change to another step if
 * some things that should have been done before that step were not done yet.
 *
 * Note that the condition is met only while the step is being activated. Once
 * the step is active, the condition is no longer met (until the next time that
 * the step is being activated again). Due to this, it only makes sense to use
 * WaitForStepActivation with the same step that the WaitForStepActivation is
 * going to be added to (if used to wait for the activation of another step, the
 * WaitForStepActivation will always be inactive when that step is being
 * activated).
 *
 * Despite waiting for the step activation, WaitForStepActivation can be safely
 * created and added to a step in its setup, and several WaitForStepActivation
 * can be added to the same step without problems.
