/**
 * Waits for a property to have a specific value.
 * When the property changes its value to the specified one and the
 * WaitForProperty is active, the wait ends.
 *
 * Note that the condition can be met even if the wait did not end. The
 * condition is met if the property has the expected value. However, the wait
 * ends only when the property changes to the expected value while the WaitFor
 * is active. That is, in an active WaitFor, the condition would be met even if
 * the expected value was set in the property when the WaitFor was inactive, but
 * the wait would not end until the expected value was set again in the property
 * after the WaitFor was activated.
 *
 * Not every property can be used to wait for its value to change. Only
 * properties that have a notify signal can be used with that purpose.
 *
 * WaitForProperty with properties that do not have a notify signal can still be
 * used to enrich other WaitFors (for example, a WaitForAnd containing a
 * WaitForSignal and a WaitForProperty: waiting for a signal to be emitted but
 * only changing to the next step if, in addition, some property has some
 * value), but they can not be used alone as single WaitFors (for example,
 * waiting just for the property "visible" of some widget to have some value
 * would never end).
 *
 * Using a WaitForProperty just to perform further checks when other WaitFor
 * ends its waiting should be done only with properties that do not have a
 * notify signal. For example, if a WaitForAnd contains a WaitForSignal and a
 * WaitForProperty, and the WaitForProperty uses a property with a notify
 * signal, it may happen that the property changes to the expected value after
 * the signal was emitted. If that happens, the WaitForProperty would end its
 * waiting, and so the WaitForAnd as the WaitForSignal had already ended its
 * waiting too. It may not be the desired behavior if the WaitForProperty was
 * there to be checked only when the WaitForSignal ended. In that case, instead
 * of using a WaitForProperty, the proper way to do it is executing a custom
 * slot when the WaitForSignal ends its waiting, and checking the value of the
 * property in a "if" construction in that slot.
