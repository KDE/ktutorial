/**
 * Helper to edit KUIT semantic markup in a QTextEdit widget.
 * SemanticMarkupEdition provides several actions that ease the edition of the
 * most common KUIT semantic markup tags. The actions are added to a
 * KActionCollection using createActions(KActionCollection*).
 *
 * Triggering an action will write its associated start tag in the current
 * position of the text edit cursor. Triggering the action again will write its
 * associated end tag. When a tag needs extra information from the user to be
 * written (for example, the URL of a link element), a dialog will be shown.
 * Also, triggering the action when the cursor is between two paired start and
 * end tags will show the dialog and update the attribute.
 *
 * The action states will be updated based on the cursor of the QTextEdit.
 * Depending on its position or the current selection some actions may be
 * disabled or checked.
 *
 * When the cursor is inside any tag all the actions will be disabled. If it is
 * between two paired start and end tags they will also be disabled (except the
 * ones that show a dialog), although the action for that tag (and its paired
 * parent elements) will be checked. If the cursor is after a start tag, the
 * action for that tag will be enabled and checked (and triggering it will write
 * the end tag).
 *
 * The actions may also be disabled when their element can not be written at the
 * current position of the cursor. For example, the list action will be disabled
 * unless the cursor is after a para tag. It will be disabled too if after the
 * para tag there is a phrase element tag, as list elements can be child only of
 * para elements.
 *
 * Only the cursor position is used to update the state of the actions.
 * Selections are not taken into account.
