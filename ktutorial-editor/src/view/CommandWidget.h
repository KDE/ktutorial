/**
 * Base abstract class for command widgets.
 * Command widgets are edition widgets that use undoable commands to save the
 * data, for example, to set the name of a tutorial.
 *
 * To be done or undone by the user, the command must be added to a stack of
 * commands. The stack that the commands will be added to can be set using
 * setUndoStack(QUndoStack*) method. When the stack is set, the commands that
 * are executed to save the data are added to the stack, which effectively
 * causes them to be executed.
 *
 * However, the CommandWidget does not add the commands directly to the stack.
 * Each command can have a parent command. When this happens, the child commands
 * are done when their parent is done, and are undone when their parent is
 * undone. It makes easier to compose several small commands to be executed as
 * one bigger command.
 *
 * All the commands created in the widget have the same parent command, which is
 * the one added directly to the stack. If no parent command was set, a new one
 * is created automatically. If it has several children, its name will be the
 * window title of the widget. If it has only one child, its name will be the
 * name of its child.
 *
 * Note that if there is a stack, but no parent command and no child commands
 * (for example, because there were no changes to save), the automatically
 * created parent command is not added to the stack. However, if a parent
 * command was explicitly set it is added to the stack even if no children were
 * added to it.
 *
 * If no stack is set but there is a parent command, the commands will be added
 * to the parent without executing them.
 *
 * If no stack and no parent are set, the commands will be executed when the
 * changes are saved, but they will be deleted afterwards.
 *
 * Subclasses must implement createSaveCommands(QUndoCommand*) method. It has
 * to return the list of the commands to execute to save the changes.
