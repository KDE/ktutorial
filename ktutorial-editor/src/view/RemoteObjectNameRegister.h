/**
 * Provides information related to the names of the remote objects in the target
 * application.
 * RemoteObjectNameRegister can be used to know the names of all the remote
 * objects accessible by KTutorial in the target application, and it also
 * notifies the names of the remote objects added or removed in the target
 * application through the signals nameAdded(QString) and nameRemoved(QString).
 *
 * However, sometimes two or more remote objects may have the same name. In that
 * case, the names of one or more ancestors are required to differentiate
 * between those remote objects. The compound name that identifies a remote
 * object can be got using uniqueName(RemoteObject*). Also, given a name, the
 * remote object that it represents can be got using findObject(QString). An
 * unqualified name (without any ancestor names, just the name of the remote
 * object itself) can be used to get the best names of all the remote objects
 * represented by that unqualified name.
 *
 * The best name and the unique name of a remote object are tightly related.
 * When the name of a remote object is unique by itself, the best name of the
 * remote object is the name itself.
 * When there are other remote objects with the same name, but the remote object
 * has an ancestor with a unique name, and the remote object is the only
 * descendant of that ancestor with that name, its best name (which is also
 * unique) is the name of the ancestor and the name of the remote object. The
 * ancestor with a unique name used is the nearest one to the remote object
 * (parent preferred to grandparent, grandparent preferred to great-grandparent
 * and so on).
 * If there are more descendants of the ancestor with that name, or if there
 * is no ancestor with a unique name, the best name is composed by the name of
 * the remote object itself and the name of as many ancestors as needed to
 * obtain a unique name.
 * If there is no unique name for the remote object, the best name is composed
 * by the name of the remote object itself and the name of all of its ancestors
 * from the remote object to the deepest ancestor with a unique name, or all its
 * ancestors if none has a unique name.
 * A best name that is ambiguous, that is, identifies more than one remote
 * object, may become unique if the ambiguity solving rules from KTutorial are
 * taken into account.
 *
 * Note that a name and the remote object it represents depends on the state of
 * the target application. For example, if there is a dialog named
 * "Configuration dialog" with a button named "Ok button", its unique name could
 * be just "Ok button". However, if another dialog named "File information
 * dialog" were opened while the "Configuration dialog" was still opened, and
 * "File information dialog" had a also button called "Ok button", now the
 * unique name of the first button would be "Configuration dialog/Ok button". In
 * this situation, "Ok button" would not represent a specific remote object.
 * 
 * Also note that names are not registered when the objects are created in the
 * target application, but a slight delay is introduced instead. This prevents
 * registering objects too soon, before their name was even set in the target
 * application. While the update in the registered names is taking place the
 * methods described above should not be used. When a name update is started,
 * the signal nameUpdateStarted() is emitted; when the update is finished, the
 * signal nameUpdateFinished() is emitted. It can be checked if the register is
 * being updated or not using isBeingUpdated(). The "updating" state is only
 * enabled and the signals emitted when new objects are created; if an object is
 * deleted there is no delay in the update of the names.
