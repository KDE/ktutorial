/**
 * Simple parser for texts containing KUIT semantic markup.
 * The parser is meant to provide SemanticMarkupEdition with information about
 * the markup in the text. Thus, it is designed just for that purpose; it is not
 * a general purpose parser.
 *
 * The parser supports XML where not all the elements have been closed. For
 * example, it can parse a text with just a start tag, or a text where there
 * is an unpaired start tag inside a valid element (one with paired start and
 * end tags).
 *
 * The parser stores which elements have been opened, and when it reaches an end
 * tag it regardes as closed the newest element that matches the end tag. For
 * example, in &lt;a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;, when &lt;/a&gt;
 * is reached the second "a" element is regarded as closed. The &lt;/b&gt; will
 * be ignored, as the "b" element is no longer taken into account since its
 * parent element was closed. Note, however, that the "b" element is not closed,
 * and isElementClosed(StartTag) with that "b" element would return false.
 * Passing the first "a" element would also return false; true would be returned
 * only for the second "a" element.
 *
 * Before parsing a text, the cursor index has to be set using
 * setCursorIndex(int). Then the text can be parsed using parse(QString).
 *
 * Once parsed, the SemanticMarkupParser object provides information about the
 * parsed text regarding the cursor position. To update the information provided
 * the text must be parsed again; that is, even if the only change is in the
 * cursor index, parse(QString) has to be called again.
