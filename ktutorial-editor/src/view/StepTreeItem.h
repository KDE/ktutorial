/**
 * A TreeItem that represents a Step.
 * The tree representation of a step is:
 * Step theId
 *   |-Text: the text
 *   |-Setup:
 *   |   -The custom setup code
 *   --Tear down:
 *   |   -The custom tear down code
 *   |-Reaction
 *   |   ...
 *   |-Reaction
 *   |  ...
 *   ...
 *
 * If the id or the text aren't set yet, a placeholder is used instead. Id
 * placeholder is "(id not set)", and the text placeholder is "(text not set)"
 * (without quotes, but with parenthesis).
 *
 * The other items only appear if they have some data to show. For example, if
 * only the text of the Step is set, its representation is:
 * Step (id not set)
 *   -The text
 *
 * Note that composed elements like custom setup code don't appear at all, not
 * even the parent item with just "Setup:".
 *
 * Whenever the step data changes, the StepTreeItem and its child items
 * are updated as needed.
 *
 * Also note that the order of the child elements is always the same. Even if,
 * for example, the tear down code is set first and then the setup code, the
 * setup code item will appear first and then the tear down code item.
