/**
 * An item in a TreeModel.
 * TreeItems form tree structures that provide the data to TreeModels. The
 * TreeItems act as an adapter between the model and the real data: through
 * TreeItem custom subclasses a source of data can be represented as several
 * nested TreeItem objects that expose the data in some specific structure.
 *
 * For example, an object of a Person class with name, age and profession
 * attributes can be represented as a tree with a parent TreeItem that contains
 * the name of the person and two child TreeItems, one that contains the age and
 * one that contains the profession.
 *
 * The structure of a tree can be modified after being added to a TreeModel.
 * Changes in the layout (adding or removing child items) or the data are
 * notified to the TreeModel, which notifies the views to be updated as needed.
 *
 * TreeItem is an abstract class. Subclasses must implement its text() method,
 * that provides the data for that item to the TreeModel when DisplayRole is
 * used. They also have to emit dataChanged(TreeItem*) signal when the data to
 * be shown is modified.
