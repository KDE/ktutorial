 * Proxy for remote objects exposed by KTutorial editor support module in

 * RemoteObject represents a remote object exposed by ObjectRegister in
 * KTutorial library through DBus. Its purpose is provide an API to use the
 * remote object like any other local object, hiding the DBus complexity behind
 * it.
 *
 * To get the data, RemoteObject makes DBus calls to the
 * "org.kde.ktutorial.ObjectRegistry" interface in the DBus service specified in
 * the constructor.
 *
 * Although the idea is let other objects use it like a local object, it has to
 * communicate with the remote ObjectRegistry through DBus anyway, so the
 * methods may throw a DBusException if something goes wrong.
