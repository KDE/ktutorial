 * export the tutorial.

 * Note, however, that it does not provide a quit action (as it has more to do
 * with the application as a whole than with the files).
 *
 * FileActions provides also the URL of the current tutorial, and a way to check
 * whether it can be closed or not, warning the user if needed.
 *
 * FileActions works closely with KTutorialEditor. KTutorialEditor is used to
 * know the tutorial and whether it is clean or not. FileActions provides the
 * tutorial URL and methods to create a new tutorial, load a tutorial from an
 * URL and check whether the current tutorial was modified after the last time
 * it was saved or not.
 *
 * The KTutorialEditor window is also used as the parent for every dialog shown
